# **OpenCV Learning Repository**

This repository serves as a collection of OpenCV projects and tutorials aimed at helping individuals learn and explore computer vision using Python. It covers various fundamental techniques, algorithms, and applications that OpenCV offers, including image processing, feature detection, object tracking, and more.

## Key Topics Covered:
- **Image Processing**: Techniques like resizing, cropping, and filtering images.
- **Object Detection**: Detecting objects, faces, and features within images and videos.
- **Contours & Edge Detection**: Working with contours, edge detection, and object recognition.
- **Camera Calibration**: Calibrating a camera for 3D vision and geometric transformations.
- **Machine Learning**: Using machine learning models for object recognition and classification.

## Features:
- **Hands-on Examples**: Simple Python scripts and examples to help you understand key OpenCV concepts.
- **Step-by-Step Tutorials**: Tutorials that walk you through solving computer vision tasks.
- **Project Ideas**: Includes suggestions for projects to help reinforce learning and experimentation.

## Requirements:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Anaconda**: For managing dependencies and creating virtual environments.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run and interact with the Python code.
- **OpenCV** (`opencv-python`): For all computer vision tasks.
  
  To install the required dependencies:
  1. Create a new environment in Anaconda (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     conda create --name opencv-learning python=3.8
     conda activate opencv-learning
     ```
  2. Install Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     conda install jupyter
     ```
  3. Install OpenCV for Python:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python
     ```

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/opencv-learning.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies as outlined in the **Requirements** section.
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and explore the individual notebooks or scripts to learn more about various OpenCV concepts.

## Example Code:
```python
import cv2

# Read an image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Grayscale Image', gray)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```
